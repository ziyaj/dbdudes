\section{Deliverable 1}

User would like to use \textbf{drill down} to see the contribution to the total sales for a specific kind of product, or a specific category of products. An example question that drill down can answer is ``In my total sales, how much does Washington Apple Juice contribute to the sales?"\\
\\
User would like to use \textbf{roll up} to see the summarized statistics, such as total sales and total expenses. An example question that roll up can answer is ``Given the salary of each employee, how much does the company pay in total for all the salaries?"

\section{Deliverable 2}

Drill down on the drink products and find \textit{Washington Apple Juice}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The grand total of all daily unit sales is \textbf{1554}.
	\item \begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Monday} has the highest number of sales for that product (265).
			\item The sales are not evenly distributed. Monday 265, Tuesday 197, Wednesday 244, Thursday 184, Friday 214, Saturday: 221, Sunday: 229. So Friday, Saturday, and Sunday's sales are roughly 220, Monday and Wednesday have more than 240, but Tuesday and Thursday have below 200 sales.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item A business want to track the total number of unit sales on a particular day to determine how many sales they made on that day. For example, if the business has a promotion event on that particular day, the business would like to measure how effective the promotion is.
	\item A business want to identify outliers because they don't want to make business decisions imprecisely on these outliers. For example, Washington Apple Juice is very unpopular in a retail shop. One day, a rich man who happen to travel to the city and goes into the shop and buys all the Washington Apple Juice, this data should be excluded because the Washington Apple Juice is unpopular for the shop's daily customers.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deliverable 3}

\begin{itemize}
	\item the Data Cube in specified in the``FROM" clause in MDX.
	\item the drill down dimensions and filter expressions are specified in the ``ON COLUMNS" list in MDX.
	\item the data we would like to see for particular filters is selected in the ``ON ROWS" list in MDX.
\end{itemize}

The MDX query results are a drill-down of the total unit sales in the Data Cube from Step 4. It drills down the total unit sales to three categories --- drink, food, and non-consumable.

\texttt{a) Query Unit Sales and Store Cost of "Drink".}\\

\section{Deliverable 6}

Choose (a) -- creating and running an MDX query

\begin{verbatim}
SELECT { [Bachelor Degree], [Graduate Degree], [High School Degree] } ON COLUMNS,
       { Measures.[Employee Count], Measures.[Overtime Count] } ON ROWS
FROM   [HR]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{deliverable6.jpg}\\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Explanation:}\\
\\
This query result answers the question``How does education level of employees affect their overtime hours". We can see that 287 Bachelor employees work 71325 overtime hours -- on average 249 hours/employee; 170 Graduate employees work 45310 overtime hours -- on average 267 hours/employee; 281 High School employees work 70544 overtime hours -- on average 251 hours/employee. So employees with Graduate degrees tend to work overtime more often.

\section{Deliverable 7}
